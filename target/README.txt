Don't delete this file!

It is here merely to preserve the tomcat owned parent directory: target.

Git does not version control empty directories so if you delete this file, the parent directory goes with it.

The next time someone clones this repo from GitHub, this file will hopefully keep the parent directory owned by tomcat so that Jenkins can properly build within the repo under that user and then deploy to tomcat.
